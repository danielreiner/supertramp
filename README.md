iPhone / iPod touch App Project: Supertrumpf / Quartett - Spiel (engl. "Top Trumps")

**Functionality:**

Early Approach: 

The App provides a deck of cards of one theme and the posibility to join another game. Players can buy more card decks of diffrent themes by In-App Purchases.


Two to four Players compare diffrent categories of a specific theme. The one with the strongest value of the compared category wins and gets the compared cards of the others.

Cards get shuffled and shared between the players. The card to be compared is the each top. If a player has only 3 left he can choose which cards to compare. The loosers will have to give the cards to the winner.
